TOP PRIORITY
------------
- Create better documentation (html docs, finish Doxygen docs).

MID PRIORITY
------------
- mrStackTrace_linux.h was written from code taken from the web,
  but was not tested or even compiled on a linux box yet.
- Fix z in fromScreen to mrVector.inl
  It currently does not match mray's z and for the life of me can't
  figure how mray encodes it.
- Add mrOctree   as an acceleration structure.
- Add mrPlucker  for plucker coordinates
- Add filterednoise()
- Add Musgrave fractals: fBm(), vfBm, VLNoise, turbulence,
			 ridge multifractals, etc.
- Create environment shader to use libtiff?
- Add AETemplates for all shader demos



LOW PRIORITY
------------
- Create light shader reading shadows from libtiff
- Add mrDifferentials.h  for tracing ray differentials?  Is this needed now
  that mi_raster_unit is available?
- Add quaternion class?
- Check mrWorley to make it faster?
- Perlin noise should optionally return gradients?
- Add mrInterval for interval arithmetic 
  (boost/numeric/interval is pretty amazing)
